# Veridian Platform Overview

Veridian is an open-source platform designed to support the verification needs of the future.
Our approach enables scalable identifier management and modular use of Verifiable Credentials with enterprise-grade security.
This includes key compromise recovery and protection against threats such as quantum attacks.

The platform consists of user-facing applications, backend services, and high-availability cloud infrastructure, offering complete composability for independent development.
Additionally, out-of-the-box sandbox environments are available on request for end-to-end experimentation and testing.

## Components

### Wallet

The Veridian mobile wallet is a user-friendly, white-label solution for managing Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials on your device.
Built on the KERI and ACDC identity protocols, we enable identity for both individuals and organizations, where security is at the heart of our design!

### Infrastructure

Veridian's infrastructure includes high-availability cloud agents and KERI witnesses.
These components are designed for easy deployment, requiring no specialized knowledge.
Our goal is to lower the barrier to entry, and ensure deployments follow security best practices!

### Services

The Veridian sandboxes offer access to our Credential Management tooling, empowering organizations to bootstrap their use-cases effortlessly.
Our tooling leverages Cardano's immutability for discovery and disaster recovery mechanisms, with verifiable smart contract integration coming soon!
