# Introduction

**Veridian Sandbox** is our containerized testing environment designed to support users of the Veridian Wallet mobile app by providing the necessary identity infrastructure and services for testing decentralized identity use cases. It is hosted in the Cardano Foundationâ€™s secure, on-premise data center in Switzerland and offers a robust and secure environment for development teams and integrators.

Security is enforced through password protection and whitelisted IP access, and all data is isolated within individual sandbox environments. The platform adheres to GDPR compliance, with all sandbox data scheduled for deletion after engagement ends. The sandbox is built with high availability and hosted in a resilient, enterprise-grade infrastructure to ensure consistent and high-assurance performance during testing.
