# Introduction

**Veridian Sandbox** is our containerized testing environment designed to support users of the Veridian Wallet mobile app by providing the necessary identity infrastructure and services for testing decentralized identity use cases.
It offers a robust and secure environment for development teams and integrators.

All data is isolated within individual sandbox environments and the platform supports data privacy regulations â€” with all sandbox data scheduled for deletion after engagement ends.
The sandbox is built with high availability and hosted in a resilient, enterprise-grade infrastructure to ensure consistent and high-assurance performance during testing.
