# Onboarding

The onboarding process is your first step towards using the Veridian Wallet and managing your digital identity with ease.
You can either set up a new wallet or [recover](../recovery) an existing one from a previous installation.

## Infrastructure
Our wallet leverages cloud infrastructure for performance, high availability and recoverability.
Please check out our [infrastructure guide](../infra) for more information; you will need access to a cloud agent before onboarding your wallet.

## Mobile minimum requirements

Security is very important to us, so we intend to only support devices that we consider secure.
Your mobile device must have a hardware element for secure cryptography — most modern Android devices, and all supported iOS devices include one.

In addition, only the following operating system versions are supported; any earlier versions no longer receive security updates.

- **iOS:** Version 18.0 — Crystal
- **Android:** Version 12 — Snow Cone (API level 31)

## Wallet setup

For new users, please follow these steps; we've also attached a video at the bottom of the page!

<Steps>
### Install and launch the app
Install the app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/veridian-wallet/id6590628073) or [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.cardanofoundation.idw), and launch the Veridian Wallet!
Once loaded, you can click `Get started`.
 
### Create a passcode
Choose a secure passcode.
This passcode will be used to access the app and may be used to perform critical functions within the app.

If your phone supports it, you will be asked to optionally set up biometrics too!
For now, biometrics are only used for login.

<Callout type="warning">
  We only support "secure" biometrics, so you may not see the biometric prompts on your device.

  In Android, face ID is not considered secure and even some fingerprint scanners have been deemed insecure.
</Callout>

### Create an operations password (optional!)
The operations password is a more secure alternative to the passcode.
Once enabled, you will need to use it instead of the passcode for operations when the app is unlocked.

The passcode or biometrics will still be used to unlock the app.

### Generate your recovery phrase
The app will display an 18-word recovery phrase — write it down and store it in a secure location.

For technical readers, the recovery phrase is a BIP-39 conversion of a salt in the KERI ecosystem, which is different from Cardano crypto wallets.
These salts are not quite the right length for BIP-39, so they have been padded with zeros to convert to 18 words.
You might notice `abandon` appears often towards the end of generated recovery phrases, but don't worry — this padding is not used for cryptographic functions.

<Callout type="warning">
  Right now, this recovery phrase is the only way to restore your wallet if your device is lost or reset.
  Going forward, we will be exploring how to use multi-sig identifiers for multi-device and social-recovery.
  And don't worry, your existing identifiers will be migratable from the recovery phrase.
</Callout>

After accepting the terms of use, you will be asked to verify the order of the words to ensure you copied it correctly.

### SSI agent details
Enter your Boot and Connect URLs.
Where these are found depends on your infrastructure deployment; for example, sandbox users will receive an email to bootstrap their wallet to the cloud agent.

### Complete
Finally, you can set your display name.
Please note that this will be shared when connecting with other wallets and services.

Now you’re ready to explore the wallet’s features.
