# Overview
The **Veridian infrastructure** supports multiple deployment models to help you build and test Veridian Wallet integrations in a secure and flexible way. Whether you prefer a hosted option or want to self-deploy the stack, Veridian provides a clear path from initial setup to a fully operational identity environment.

We currently support two modes of deployment:
- **Hosted Sandbox**: A secure, containerized testing environment hosted in the Cardano Foundation’s on-premise Swiss data center. Ideal for teams who want to validate Veridian Wallet use cases without managing infrastructure.
- **Self Deployment**: A flexible option for those who prefer to run Veridian services in their own infrastructure. We support a simple Docker Compose setup as well as a scalable Helm-based deployment for Kubernetes environments.

Each option provides access to the core Veridian identity services with built-in security, data isolation, and compliance with industry standards such as GDPR. Whether you’re just getting started or preparing for production use, Veridian infrastructure is designed to grow with your needs.
