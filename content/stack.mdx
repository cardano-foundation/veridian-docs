# Getting Started

There are various implementations of KERI out there, and the reference implementation is called [keripy](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy).
keripy implements KERI, ACDC and CESR at a low level, along with some helper functionality and a cli tool called the kli.
One could take keripy as-is and integrate it into any Python backend directly, but we don't recommend this unless you are very familiar with the implementation.

## KERIA & Signify

[KERIA](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria) is a multi-agent cloud service that is based on keripy, designed to service edge clients.
Edge clients can use a library called Signify to interact with KERIA securely, and there are implementations in [TypeScript](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts) and [Python](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signifypy), with a Java library coming soon.
KERIA only serves as infrastructure to help edge agents interact with others, securely store data and in general lighten the load at the edge.
The actual keys of an edge client's identifiers never leave the edge, at least not unencrypted.

<Callout type="info">
  A Self Sovereign Identity agent is a service or application that is capable of understanding an identity protocol.
  You might have an agent on your mobile device which acts as your wallet, or an agent in the cloud which is authenticating users. 
</Callout>

We recommend this approach as it abstracts away many of the lower level complexities and provides a more simple, higher level Signify API.
It also means that you can deploy a zero trust network architecture across your services in a more lightweight and approachable way.

KERIA runs on three separate ports â€” by default 3901, 3902 and 3903:
- **3901:** This is the **connect** port and is used by Signify clients to interact with the KERIA API to do things such as creating an identifier, or issuing an ACDC.
It must be accessible by any edge clients.
- **3902:** This port must be open to every other KERI agent you want to interact with, so this is typically publicly accessible.
- **3903:** This is the **boot** port, and is used to onboard or bootstrap a new edge agent into the KERIA instance.
This should not be publicly accessible, and your business logic can determine how to give access to an edge client.
In our sandboxes, we share one-time use URLs by email for example.

Take a look at our [infrastructure](../infra) guide to get access to a KERIA instance!

<Callout type="warning">
  In general, we contribute any changes to keripy, KERIA or Signify back to the WebOfTrust community and don't sit on forks.
  However, at the time of writing we are on forks as we're in the process of contributing large features such as ESSR back.

  This Signify-TS [branch](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/signify-ts/tree/build/v1) should be used to interact with the KERIA infrastructure we deploy.
  If the branch no longer exists, chances are we are back on `WebOfTrust/main` and need to remove this warning!
</Callout>

### Key Management & Booting

KERI as a protocol only cares about key pairs and signatures, and does not enforce how or where one stores their keys.
Out of the box, Signify offers different [options](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria/blob/main/docs/protocol.md#key-generate-methods) with a default of Salty Keys.
Our mobile wallet uses Salty Keys, but in the longer term we plan on moving to HSM Keys.

A Signify client is initialized using a 21 character CESR seed.
This seed is used to generate public-private key pairs deterministically, and the keys are used to secure the communication with KERIA and encrypt any cryptographic key material we may want to store on KERIA.
In the implementation and tests, this seed is often referred to as the bran or passcode.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { SignifyClient, ready } from "signify-ts";

await ready();
const client = new SignifyClient(
  config.keria.url,
  randomPasscode(),
  Tier.low,
  config.keria.bootUrl
);

await client.boot();
```

Line 3 is used to initialize libsodium, so must be called when starting up your application.
The seed or passcode is generated on line 6, so this should be stored securely.
In our wallet, we encode the passcode using BIP-39 for the user to write down.

When we call boot, a KERI identifier is generated which is used to secure the communication with KERIA.
The KEL of the identifier will be sent to KERIA, and in response KERIA will bootstrap a cloud agent.
The cloud agent will have its own KERI identifier, and set of databases which are separate from all other agents.

The set of edge and cloud identifiers form a KERI delegation relationship in this boot phase, so there is a one to one mapping.
The cloud agent will only accept API requests signed by the edge identifier, and the edge identifier will only accept API responses from the cloud identifier.

<Callout type="info">
  The KERIA-Signify API is also fully encrypted using a technique called Encrypt Sender and Sign Receiver, which provides incredibly robust security.
  It is detailed in the [SPAC](https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/SPAC_Message.md#best-combined-authenticity-and-confidentiality) paper, and forms the base of the [Trust Spanning Protocol](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-tsp-specification/) at Trust over IP.
</Callout>

At this point, there will be a KERI agent in the cloud which the edge client can interact with, and which serves as mailbox for receiving messages and requests from other KERI agents or services.

### Connecting

Directly after booting for the first time, or any time we wish to re-initialize a Signify client for an existing cloud agent, we can call the connect function.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { SignifyClient, ready } from "signify-ts";

...

await client.connect();
```

Signify itself is stateless, so this passcode must be passed to it each time you want to re-connect to your cloud agent.
This connect call with initialize the Signify client by fetching the KEL of the cloud identifier, and some other counter information.
It will verify the delegation relationship with the identifier which can be created from the passcode.

At this point, you are ready to do whatever you need to satisfy your business logic!
