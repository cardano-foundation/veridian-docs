# Async in KERI

As we touched on previously, KERI was built with scalability in mind.
Implementors of KERI strongly prefer asynchronous communications for its scalability, and is designed to handle out-of-order messaging.
Even keripy and KERIA are both built on a powerful library for implementing hierarchical structured concurrency called [hio](https://github.com/ioflo/hio).

As a result, most operations that you can perform with a Signify client are asynchronous.
For example, when you create a managed identifier for a user, it will be in a pending state until it receives a threshold amount of witness receipts.

```ts showLineNumbers
const result = await client.identifiers().create(name, {
  toad: 2,
  wits: [
    "BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha",
    "BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM",
    "BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX",
  ]
});

const operation = await result.op();
const complete = (await client.operations().get(operation.name)).done;
```

In the above example, we are using the `GET /operations/{name}` endpoint to check if a long running operation is complete.

<Callout type="warning">
  A complete operation can have succeeded or failed.
  In both cases `done` will be true, so you should check if there is an `error` in the operation response too.
</Callout>

Operations can be deleted afterwards if desired.

## Dependencies

A long running operation can depend on another long running operation to be considered fully complete, which is embedded in the `metadata.depends` field.
As it currently stands, an operation can be considered done before it's dependency is done - detailed [here](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria/issues/200).

## Event Driven Approach

Continuous polling for operation completion itself isn't quite so scalable.
As a community, we intend to implement an [event driven approach](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria/issues/290) using server sent events.
SSE is a lightweight approach that is native HTTP, and avoids the need to add extra infrastructure such as message brokers.
