# Notifications

KERIA runs a CESR parser which can parse KERI and CESR events.
These events can be user triggered (e.g. creating an identifier) or they could be received on the public endpoint from other KERI agents trying to interact with you.

Whenever certain event types are processed successfully, notifications will be triggered.
Most notifications generally relate to receiving new exchange (exn) messages, most commonly IPEX (`/exn/ipex/*`) or group coordination messages (`/multisig/*`).

For example, if you are being issued a credential, you will receive a notification which looks something like this:
```json
{
  "i": "0ACLhRGzyQnNu17Kn8NR2Mtr",
  "dt": "2025-03-27T14:14:58.609560+00:00",
  "r": false,
  "a": {
    "r": "/exn/ipex/grant",
    "d": "EEWOwbmK8n8pu2whXfhuVdMk8jJKI1TFMxs8_JFNq0YK",
    "m": ""
  }
}
```

Here, we have a notification with ID `0ACLhRGzyQnNu17Kn8NR2Mtr` route `/exn/ipex/grant`.
It doesn't tell us anything about the exn message itself except it's ID, in the `a.d` field.

`client.exchanges().get(notification.a.d)` can be used to retrieve the exchange message itself, which contains more relevant information for that specific notification.

## Fetching

A paginated list of notifications can be retrieved using the `notifications().list()` method.
Notifications can be marked as read, which updates the `r` field, or deleted to remove completely.

  At the time of writing, there is no way to filter the `list()` method by read or unread.
  PRs are welcome!

Of course, a more event driven approach will eventually come, in the same manner as for [operation tracking](./async).
