# Recovery

Recovering your wallet allows you to restore your digital identity on a new or reset device â€” even if your original device has been lost.
To ensure uninterrupted access, all existing identifiers, connections and credentials will be restored securely from the cloud.

This is only possible using your recovery phrase, so make sure it's kept safe!
Please follow the steps below, and once again, we've attached a video tutorial.

<Steps>
### Install and launch the app
Install the app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app6590628073) or [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.cardanofoundation.idw), and launch the Veridian Wallet!

### Select the recovery flow
Select the `I already have a wallet` button on the landing screen.
During onboarding, you can freely switch between creating a new wallet and recovering an existing wallet if necessary.

### Create a passcode and operations password (optional!)
Like in the [onboarding flow](../onboarding), you will be asked to create a passcode, setup biometrics and optionally set an operations password.

### Enter your recovery phrase
Input the exact words from your recovery phrase in the correct order.

If you input the recovery phrase incorrectly, you will receive an error when trying to connect to your SSI agent on the next screen, indicating that the account does not exist.

### SSI agent details
When recovering, you just need to provide the Connect URL.
The Connect URL must match the one used in the onboarding flow.

<Callout type="warning">
  For you, you will need to connect to the same SSI agent for recovery.
  We are exploring cloud migrations at present.
</Callout>

### Restore complete

The app will restore all identifiers, connections, and credentials securely from the cloud, and launch as normal.
You will be asked to set your name again.
