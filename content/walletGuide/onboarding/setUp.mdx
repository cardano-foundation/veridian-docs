# Set Up Your Wallet

To access your wallet, you can either set up a new one or recover an existing one. If you’re using the app for the first time, you’ll need to set up a new wallet to create your digital identity and get your recovery phrase. If you’ve already created a wallet before, you can recover it by entering your recovery phrase.

Follow the instructions below for the option that applies to you.

## Set Up a New Wallet

Setting up your wallet is the first step toward managing your digital identity with ease. With the Veridian Wallet, you can create and control decentralized identifiers, receive and present verifiable credentials, establish secure connections and participate in group multisignature flows — all while maintaining complete control over your personal data.
