# Set Up Your Wallet

To access your wallet, you can either set up a new one or recover an existing one. If you’re using the app for the first time, you’ll need to set up a new wallet to create your digital identity and get your recovery phrase. If you’ve already created a wallet before, you can recover it by entering your recovery phrase.

Follow the instructions below for the option that applies to you.

## Set Up a New Wallet

Setting up your wallet is the first step toward managing your digital identity with ease. With the Veridian Wallet, you can create and control decentralized identifiers, receive and present verifiable credentials, establish secure connections and participate in group multisignature flows — all while maintaining complete control over your personal data.

Follow the steps below:

<Steps>
### Open the App
Launch the Veridian Wallet on your mobile device.
 
### Create a Passcode
Choose a secure passcode. This passcode will be used to access the app.

### Create an Operations Password (Optional)
The operations password is a more secure alternative to the passcode. Once enabled, you will need to use it instead of the passcode for certain operations. 

The passcode or biometrics will still be used to unlock the app.


### Generate Recovery Phrase

The app will display a 18-word recovery phrase. Write it down and store it in a secure location.

### SSI Agent Details
Veridian Wallet leverages a cloud agent that runs KERI protocols and interfaces with other agents on the internet. You can find the specific Boot and Connect URLs in the email that was distributed separately.

Please note that the Boot URL within the email is unique.


### Complete Setup

You can set your display name so when connecting with other wallets and services, this name will be shared. 


</Steps>

Now you’re ready to explore the wallet’s features.

## Recover an Existing Wallet

Recovering your wallet allows you to restore your digital identity, including your identifiers, connections, and credentials, on a new or reset device. This ensures uninterrupted access to your verifiable credentials, secure connections, and identity-related activities — even if your original device is lost or replaced.
