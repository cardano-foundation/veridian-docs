# Groups

A fundamental aspect of organizational identity is group multi-sig identifiers.
Let's explore KERI's approach from an implementation point of view, which helps things like group coordination.

<Callout type="info">
  Multi-sig identifiers could be used to represent the same person for recovery purposes, such as multi-device.
  For now, we assume a group of different people or machines.
</Callout>

The `multisig-incept.test.ts` integration test can be used to reference for creation.
There are also other `multisig*.test.ts` files which cover credential issuance, rotation and IPEX.

## Group creation

From a protocol perspective, a group is a single multi-sig identifier, where keys are controlled by different wallets.
The protocol doesn't concern itself with how those keys are controlled, or how signatures are collected, but `keripy` has a certain approach.

Each member of a group creates a "member" identifier which is single-sig.
The member identifiers can be used to communicate amongst themselves, and the key state of each member identifier can "copied" into the multi-sig events.

So each member of the group will have 2 managed Signify identifiers for every group:
1. Their local member identifier, which is single-sig.
2. Their group identifier, which is multi-sig.

<Callout type="warning">
  Ideally, each member should use watchers to watch every other group member.
  This protects against compromise of a group member, as well as if any member suddenly becomes malicious.

  As such, member identifiers should use witnesses as well despite not being a public facing identifier.
</Callout>

In the Signify APIs, you will notice references to `mhab` and `ghab`.
A habitat, or hab is the term in keripy used to describe an identifier at the data layer.
Hence, `mhab` is the member hab, and `ghab` is the group hab.

### Setup local member identifiers

All that's required at this stage is each member creates a single-sig identifier, and [OOBIs](../../foundations/oobis) are exchanged.
A member identifier should only be used for a single group, and not otherwise re-used.
This ensures:
- A clean separation in general.
- A key compromise doesn't impact multiple identifiers or groups, only one.
- A unique group prefix.
Creating a group with the same members, and parameters such as threshold might result in the same prefix.
See the next section below.

### Inception

As we know, the prefix of a group identifier is the digest of the inception event.
This time, the inception event will contain multiple signing keys, and next key digests, as well as thresholds for both.
Since it's a digest, a different initial threshold, or a different ordering of the keys results in a different identifier.

```ts useLineNumbers
import { Algos } from "signify-ts";

const memberStates = [];
for (const memberPrefix of membersPrefixes) {
  const state = await client.keyStates().get(memberPrefix);
  memberStates.push(state[0]);
}

const mhab = await client.identifiers().get(memberPrefix);
const result = await client.identifiers().create(groupName, {
  algo: Algos.group,
  mhab,
  isith: 2,
  nsith: 2,
  toad: 2,
  wits: [
    "BBilc4-L3tFUnfM_wJr4S4OJanAv_VmF_dJNN6vkf2Ha",
    "BLskRTInXnMxWaGqcpSyMgo0nYbalW99cGZESrz3zapM",
    "BIKKuvBwpmDVA4Ds-EpL5bt9OqPzWPja2LigFYZN2YfX"
  ],
  states: memberStates,
  rstates: memberStates
});
```

`isith` represents the current signing threshold, which can be different to `nsith`, the rotation threshold.
If an integer is used, each member has equal rights but KERI supports fractionally weighted thresholds too.
A threshold of `["2/3", "1/3", "1/3"]` requires signatures from Alice and Bob, or Alice and Carol.
However Bob and Carol together cannot complete signing as their thresholds only sum to `2/3`, which is less than 1.

In this particular example, each group member contributes current signing keys and next key digests, so each member has partial control of signing and rotation of the identifier.
You could choose to separate the member identifiers which can sign and which can rotate, such as for custodial use cases.

The inception event is not valid until a threshold amount sign it (`isith`).
Each interaction event thereafter also requires `isith` signatures, and a rotation event requires `nsith`.
Of course, after being sufficiently signed by the group members, it will then need to be sufficiently witnessed by the witnesses.

#### Retrieving states

In the above example, we used the `keyStates().get` method to retrieve the current key state of an identifier.
The state returned is the last known state our KERIA agent is aware of.

The `keyStates().query` method can be used to fetch key state updates for an identifier.
This will be better handled when watchers are integrated into KERIA, and updates can come continuously with stronger security guarantees.
For us, this is on our near term roadmap to implement.

#### Coordination

It's up to your application to decide on how to coordinate who should create the inception event.
In our wallet, there is a designated group initiator or leader, and we plan on adding functionality to be able to update the leader at a later point.

When the initiator of the group is ready, they can create the group using `identifiers().create`.
After, they must send the inception event to the other group members as a signaling mechanism.

```ts useLineNumbers
import { d, Siger } from "signify-ts";

// const result = await client.identifiers().create(...
const serder = result.serder;

const sigers = result.sigs.map(sig => new Siger({ qb64: sig }));
const ims = d(messagize(serder, sigers));
const atc = ims.substring(serder.size);
const embeds = { icp: [serder, atc] };

const smids = memberStates.map((state) => state["i"]);

await client.exchanges().send(
  memberPrefix,
  groupPrefix,
  mhab,
  "/multisig/icp",
  { gid: serder.pre, smids, rmids: smids },
  embeds,
  otherMemberPrefixes
);
```

This creates an exchange message with route `/multisig/icp` that's signed by the member identifier, and sent to all other members to signal.
The partially signed inception event (`serder`) is embedded within the exchange message, but the exchange message itself is fully signed because it was sent from the member identifier.

This allows the other group members to listen for notifications on that route.
If they are happy with the inception event, they can sign it too by calling `identifiers().create` and sending back the same `/multisig/icp` messages to signal they have joined.

<Callout type="warning">
  For a given group, the `smids` array contains each of the local member prefixes for each member.
  `rmids` is the same but for rotation, and in many cases the 2 arrays will be the same.

  When sending exchange messages, such as IPEX messages with KERIA, once it is fully signed the group leader will send the message to the recipient, such as the issuer.
  The group leader is the first identifier in the `smids` array, and in this sense, the message will only actually get sent if the leader has contributed to the signatures.
  
  Please see [this discussion](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/discussions/934) related to group coordination.
  Right now we recommend that the group leader always be the first to sign any message.
</Callout>

#### Long running operations

Long running operations for group creation and rotation will only complete once sufficiently signed by other group members (and witnessed).
The same applies for sending an exchange message: it won't complete until sufficiently signed.
Hence, the operation completion signals we've collected enough signatures!

### Group OOBIs

For a single-sig identifier, setting up the OOBI was pretty straightforward.
We simply authorized our KERIA agent to have the `agent` end role, which under the hood signs an end role authorization object.

For groups, if Alice wants to authorize _her_ KERIA agent in this role, a threshold amount will need to sign the end role object too.
This needs to be repeated for each group member and their KERIA agent if we want all members to receive notifications.

However, there are cases where that would be unnecessary, such as if one group member was only used for disaster recovery purposes and was not concerned with signing IPEX messages.
Adjust as you see fit!

```ts useLineNumbers
const members = await client.identifiers().members(groupPrefix);
```

The above call will return the `smids` and `rmids` lists with more details, such as the existing end role authorizations for member identifiers.
This means every member could automatically authorize every relevant KERIA agent quite easily.
A rough example might look something like:

```ts useLineNumbers
const members = await client.identifiers().members(groupPrefix);

for (const member of members.signing) {
  const eid = Object.keys(member.ends.agent)[0];
  const endRoleResult = await client.identifiers().addEndRole(
    groupPrefix,
    "agent",
    eid,
    new Date().toISOString().replace("Z", "000+00:00")
  );
  await endRoleResult.op();

  const rpy = endRoleResult.serder;
  const seal = [
    "SealEvent",
    {
      i: groupPrefix,
      s: gHab.state["ee"]["s"],
      d: gHab.state["ee"]["d"]
    }
  ];
  const sigers = endRoleResult.sigs.map((sig: string) => new Siger({ qb64: sig }));
  const roleims = signify.d(signify.messagize(rpy, sigers, seal, undefined, undefined, false));
  const atc = roleims.substring(rpy.size);
  const roleembeds = { rpy: [rpy, atc] };

  await client.exchanges().send(
    memberPrefix,
    groupPrefix,
    mhab,
    "/multisig/rpy",
    { gid: groupPrefix },
    roleembeds,
    otherMemberPrefixes
  );
}
```

### Using the identifier

Signing will either be KEL-backed, such as for credential issuance, or ephemeral, such as for IPEX.

#### KEL-backed

KEL-backed will either involve directly calling `identifiers().interact`, or indirectly by creating a registry, issuing a credential, etc.
After performing the interaction event, it will be partially signed until enough members join.

Like we did for the group inception and end role authorization, we will signal to other group members using exchange messages.
The route of the exchange message depends on the action being performed:
- `/multisig/vcp`: Registry creation
- `/multisig/iss`: ACDC issuance
- `/multisig/rev`: ACDC revocation
- `/multisig/ixn`: Other interaction event

#### Exchange messages

When creating an exchange message for a group:
1. One member creates the message, and the sender of the exchange message is the group identifier.
2. The member embeds the partially signed group message within another exchange message.
3. The wrapping exchange message sender is the local group member, so it is immediately fully signed.
4. This message is sent to other group member identifiers with the `/multisig/exn` route, and the other members can extract the embedded group message and sign it.

### Rotation

The keys from the inception event were sourced from the local member identifier KELs.
We continue this practice for every rotation event thereafter.

As such, the general flow is:
1. Group members decide to rotate out of band (coordinate based on your needs).
2. Each group member rotates their single-sig identifier.
3. A group member (most likely the leader) creates the rotation event, and signals in the same way as for inception, except using the `/multisig/route` route.

Care needs to be taken here for coordination, particularly if the group is signing other things like IPEX messages while rotating.
The community is currently implementing rollback functionality in case a rotation needs to be aborted, as well as "catch-up" functionality in case they were offline.

#### Partial rotation

In the above steps, every group member rotated their keys.
There may be scenarios where you only want some members to rotate, and others to maintain their keys.
This is allowed as long as a rotational-threshold amount of group members rotate their keys.
