# User APIs

Here we plan on covering the more common and fundamental aspects of user-centric interfaces.
We don't intend on covering everything here, it's more to get a feel for what you can do.
We'll also try to include any particular gotchas to look out for.

Until these docs can grow over time with deeper tutorials, we recommend referencing the Signify integration tests for specific flows, or asking for help in [our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/9yNneV8Ktv) or the [WebOfTrust Discord](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keri?tab=readme-ov-file#discord).
