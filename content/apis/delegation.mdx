# Delegation

Please make sure to read the protocol [delegation section](../protocols/delegation) first.
Delegated authority via ACDCs is covered already by issuing ACDCs with edges.

## Delegated identifiers

Creating a delegated identifier in KERI is pretty simple.
The delegate points to the delegator using the `delpre` field.
This will insert the delegator prefix within the inception event of the delegate.
The delegate identifier will be pending until the delegator anchors the prefix and sequence number (`0` to begin with) in their KEL.

```ts useLineNumbers
const result = await delegateClient.identifiers().create(
  "delegate",
  { delpre: delegatorPrefix }
);

// Inception event in this case
const anchor = {
  i: delegatePrefix,
  s: "0",
  d: delegatePrefix,
};

const result = await delegatorClient.delegations().approve(delegatorPrefix, anchor);
```
