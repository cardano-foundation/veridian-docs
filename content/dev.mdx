# Welcome

Decentralized identity is hard, especially when using powerful protocols like KERI and ACDC!
So, we'd like to make that a bit easier for you, and help you secure your applications the right way.

For now, these developer docs focus on helping you integrate these protocols into your applications, whether they are cloud services, IoT edge devices or something else.
The mobile wallet we've built, along with other tools and products we are aiming to build over the next while should solve many of the hard problems.
However, it's up to you to integrate these technologies into your business logic!

These docs will be ever growing, and we happily accept contributions on Github!
We intend to include more visual examples, and more complete code snippets over time.
