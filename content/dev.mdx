# Welcome

Decentralized identity is hard, especially when using powerful protocols like KERI and ACDC!
So we'd like to make that a bit easier for you, and get you on your way to securely your applications the right way.

For now, the focus of these developer docs is to help you integrate these protocols into your applications, whether they are cloud services, IoT edge devices or whatever else.
The mobile wallet we've built, along with other tools and products we are aiming to build over the next while should solve many of the hard problems; but it's up to you to integrate your applications and business rules to best take advantage of these technologies.

These docs will be ever growing, and we happily accept contributions on Github!
