# Cardano Connect

Cardano Connect is a feature of the Veridian Wallet that allows you to seamlessly connect with Cardano dApps using your wallet, leveraging the [CIP-45](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0045) standard.
Currently, this feature supports only Individual identifiers, but we plan to extend support for Group identifiers in the future.

To test Cardano Connect, you can visit our sample dApp at this link: [Cip45 Sample Dapp](https://cip45.dev.idw-sandboxes.cf-deployments.org/).

Alternatively, you can run the dApp locally by following the instructions in [the project repository](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/veridian-wallet/tree/main/services/cip45-sample-dapp).

<Callout type="info">
  To use this feature, you'll need to have an Individual identifier created in
  your wallet. For guidance on creating one, please refer to the [Identifiers
  page](./individualid#creation).
