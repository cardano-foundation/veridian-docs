# Settings

To access the app settings, first navigate to the main menu using the bottom right tab.
The gear icon can be clicked to access the settings.

From here, you will find general settings, some useful links, as well as a way to delete your account.

## Security
The security section allows you to manage your biometrics, passcode and operations password.
The operations password can be enabled, disabled or updated.

It also allows you to view your recovery phrase in case you have lost physical access to it.

<Callout type="info">
  As before, if your device does not support secure biometrics, the biometric options will not be visible in this menu.

## Account deletion
Deleting your account will delete all identifiers, connections and credentials and allow you to restart the onboarding flow.
You can still use your recovery phrase to gain access to your cloud agent, but the wallet will not contain any data and appear as if it were freshly onboarded.
