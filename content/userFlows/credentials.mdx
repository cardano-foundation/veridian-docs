# Credentials

Let's use our new connection to the issuer tool!
Check out the [previous page](./connections) if you haven't already.
Please note we recently revamped the UI for this tool, so it's missing many UX enhancements to come.

## Obtaining a credential

<Callout type="warning">
  If you receive notifications from an `Unknown` issuer, you likely have not set up the connection properly.
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Select a template to issue
Firstly, ensure the `Issuer` account is selected in the drop-down menu on the top-right of the page.
Navigate to the credentials tab, where you will be presented with a list of different credential templates.

After deciding on a template to issue, you can use the 3-dot menu to directly issue a credential, or view details of the credential template.
Let's select view details. 

### Issue a credential
From within the credential template details, you can see a list of all previously issued credentials and their revocation statuses.
The issue credential call-to-action button can be used to begin issuing a credential.

Select the connection to your wallet, and fill in any necessary details for that credential template.
Finally, click issue!

### Accept in your wallet
Shortly after, you should receive a notification within your wallet.
Navigate to the notifications tab and open the notification.

You can review the credential issuance, and accept it.
At this point, the credential will be pending in your wallet, but it should complete very quickly for Individual identifiers.

### View credential details
Once the credential has been fully received and is no longer pending, you will be able to view its details.

## Presenting your credential

<Steps>
### Navigate to the presentation request screen
Firstly, switch to the `Verifier` account within the tool using the drop-down on the top right.
You should now be able to navigate to the request presentation page.
Here, you will be able to see a history of presentation requests.

<Callout type="warning">
  The presentation request list will be lost on reload, and the status won't update.
  This is a work in progress!
</Callout>

### Request a presentation
Using the call-to-action button, we can select a connection to request a presentation from, and specify the credential template type.

You can also optionally request specific attribute values for any attributes available in that credential template type.

<Callout type="info">
  You can also request a presentation from the connections 3-dot menu, as long as you have the verifier account selected.
</Callout>

### Present credential
You should now receive a notification within the wallet requesting a presentation.
The notification will contain information on the connection, and what the connection is requesting you to present.

If you hold a credential that matches the criteria, you can choose to present it.
You can even present revoked credentials — this is because some credentials might have a revocation grace period, or there might be some use-case where you need to present it for auditory purposes after revocation.

Once the presentation has completed, it will be reflected in the connection history and the notification will be automatically deleted.

## Credential revocation
Most credentials will have an issued or revoked status.
Let's try revoking our new credential.

<Steps>
### Select credential to revoke
You must switch back to the `Issuer` account to revoke credentials.
You can revoke credentials from the credential template details view.
As a reminder, this page can be reached by navigating to the credentials tab, clicking the 3-dot menu of a particular credential template and viewing the details.

### Revoke
You can now revoke any credential that has been issued, as long as it hasn't already been revoked.
Click the 3-dot menu for a specific issued credential, and revoke it.

You will now receive a notification in your wallet that your credential has been revoked.
The credential will also disappear from the main credential lists, and can now be found in `Archived & Revoked` section.
This is accessible at the bottom of the credential list — check out the video in the archived section below.
</Steps>

## Archiving and deletion
You are free to archive any credentials within your wallet, or delete them if you no longer have use for them.
Archiving is kept as a feature to historically track credentials that you won't be presenting anymore.

Credentials can be archived from within the credential details view.
Once archived, they will appear in the `Archived & Revoked` section at the bottom of the credential list.
As mentioned, any revoked credentials will also appear here.

From here, you can bulk delete any archived or revoked credentials as you see fit!
