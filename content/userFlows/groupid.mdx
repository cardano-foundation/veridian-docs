# Group creation

Groups are represented with threshold multi-sig identifiers.
The creation of a group identifier builds on the idea of connections, as all members will need a way to coordinate the creation and usage of the group identifier.
Remember — there's no central platform for coordination!

<Steps>
### Initiator setup
One member acts as the initiator of a group and creates a new identifier in the wallet using the Group identifier type.
Once created, a connection QR code will appear which can be shared with the other future members of the desired group.

### Member setup
The initiator's QR code that was shown is slightly different than regular connection QR codes.
Once scanned by other wallets, it will automatically bootstrap setting up the group identifier on their device.

Any other people who would like to join the group should scan the initiator QR code now, and set up theirs.

### Remaining QR exchanges
Now, each group member will have their own QR code — initiator and non-initiators alike.
The identifier will appear in the "For groups" section of the identifier list, and when opened, will it show a list of members below the QR code.
This is effectively in a draft state until the initiator finalizes the setup.

You will only be able to see members for which you have scanned QR codes, so you need to go ahead and scan everyone else's QR code.
Each member must do this.

<Callout type="info">
  This first iteration of group creation was intended to be flexible and secure, but we are aware of the complexities in scanning so many QR codes.
  It's quite easy for a group of 2, or maybe 3, but quickly gets harder.
  
  We have a design in place to implement that will drastically reduce the QR codes scanned, and use broadcasting under the hood to propagate the group member list.
  However we do it, we want to keep security as a priority.
</Callout>
### Finalize setup
Once all members are interconnected, the initiator can finalize the creation of the identifier from within the identifier details.
At this point, the initiator can remove any undesired members and set a threshold.
The threshold decides how many members need to provide a signature when using the identifier or rotating keys.

### Accept
Once finalized, a notification will be sent to all other members to accept the final configuration of the group.
If they are happy, they can accept and the group identifier will be pending until a threshold amount of members accept.
</Steps>

Once the identifier is confirmed, you can view the identifier details like before.
It will now show the various group members and thresholds.
