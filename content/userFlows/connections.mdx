# Connections

Connections can be used to interact with other wallets or services.
We will use our Credential Issuance tooling that we've built to showcase connections.

Our infrastructure deployments come loaded with this issuer tooling, so you should refer to those URLs.
For development, we use this [URL](https://cred-issuance-ui.dev.idw-sandboxes.cf-deployments.org/) — however, it is not stable or intended for production!

<Callout type="warning">
  The Credential Issuance tooling is intended to aid development of the wallet, and empower quick integration of credentials into your use cases.
  It's not yet a full fledged Credential Issuance tool that is ready for production deployments.
  At some point in the future, it certainly will be!

<Steps>
### Add the issuer connection
In the issuer tool connections tab, you can select `Add Connection` to display a connection QR code.
This QR code can be scanned using the main scanner (center tab button) of the wallet.
After scanning, the wallet will be redirected to the connections page, and there should be new connection named "CF Credential Issuance".

Within this connections page, there is another scanner which can also be used when clicking the plus icon.
The connections page itself is accessible from the identifiers tab, credentials tab and main menu (right-most tab).

### Share our identifier
You will be ready to complete the connection if you've created [an identifier](./individualid).
From within the identifier details, you can use the share button to view your connection QR code.

Now, within the issuer tool, you can click the next button in the connect flow.
From here you will have the choice of using your webcam to scan your phone, or pasting the connection URL.

You are now ready to start interacting with that connection — in this case, you would be able to [receive credentials](./credentials).

### View connection
Within the connection, you can now view the history and notes.
You are free to add any connection notes you'd like, they are never shared with the connection.
For now, the history is generally populated from interactions involving credentials!
