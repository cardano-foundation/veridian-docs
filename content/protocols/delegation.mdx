# Delegation

Delegation in KERI comes in different forms, motives and trade-offs.
Understanding where and how to apply delegation is important as it's very powerful.

## Delegated authority

When most of us think of delegation, we most likely think of the idea of allowing someone to act on our behalf.
You could use delegated identifiers to achieve this, but this is limited in flexibility.

Either a delegated identifier means you are delegating _all_ authority you have, which is perhaps not the best idea.
Or, within your ecosystem, delegated identifiers can have a well defined meaning, but this is limiting.

Delegated authority is much better achieved using credentials, particularly because of ACDC's ability to form property graphs.
For example, an IoT device could be issued a credential which allows them to report readings in a certain area of a factory.
Each reading can be an untargeted ACDC which is chained back to their credential, and valid until revocation.

<Callout type="info">
  Since ACDC issuances are anchored in issuer KELs, and a property graph may contain many different issuers, determining when an issuance and revocation occured is a little harder.
  One solution is to additionally require anchoring on a blockchain to finalise issuance or revocation, which gives a single source of truth.
  This [discussion](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/discussions/597) covers some alternative approaches that maintain KERI's global interopability.

## Delegated identifiers

Aside from the aforementioned method of using delegated identifiers to achieve delegated authority, there are 2 better functions.

### Top-down hierarchical recovery

KERI uses what is known as cooperative delegation, where a delegation relationship requires buy in from both parties, and results in some great security advantages.
The delegator will create their identifier as normal, and a delegate will embed the delegator prefix within their inception, or rotation event to begin the delegation process.
A delegation is not complete until the delegator in turn anchors a reference to the delegate's KEL event in their own.

So, it's as if the delegate asks to be delegated to, and the delegator approves.
From here on out, every establishment event performed by the delegate must be approved by the delegator, again, by anchoring the establishment event in their KEL.
However, it is possible to change the delegator identifier in this relationship, if approved by the old delegator - something to keep in mind!

From a recovery point of view, this means if the delegate identifier is compromised, including the rotation keys, a second-factor approval from the delegator is required.
In case the delegator approves accidentally, they have a second chance to approve a new rotation event which overrules the first.
No third chance!

This is part of KERI's superseded recovery mechanism, as has quite a few more details, whether it involves delegation or not.
You can for example chain together delegated identifiers so approval needs to go right up the chain.

KERI goes to great lengths to ensure secure identifiers that are recoverable on compromise.
A delegated, fractionally weighted threshold multi-sig identifier with a threshold number of witnesses and pre-rotated keys is quite the secure identifier!

### Scalability

There are 2 aspects to scalability that delegated identifiers can solve.
In both cases, the `DelegateIsDelegator` trait can be useful to indicate that the delegator and delegate are the same entity, and the separation into multiple identifiers is intended for scability reasons.

Firstly, when you are signing many things on a regular basis, this will lead to a growth of your KEL, much like a blockchain.
This "KEL bloat" can be minimized by creating numerous delegation relationships to offload signatures to other identifiers and have a strategy to segregate signing.
This way, you can direct a verifier on where to look, and avoid needing to validate many other irrelevant events.

Even more interestingly, since there can be multiple delegate's for a given delegator, we can form a tree like structure where the root identifier is the original identifier, and everything below scales.
Not only does this give you flexibility in how you segregate signing, it leads to the ability to concurrently sign with many identifiers that all lead back to the root.

Now that's powerful!
Identifiers can live in different processes, machines or even continents but all be tied to represent the same entity.
In reality, this empowers an elastic signing infrastructure which is key to adoption of zero trust networking.
Many can't accept the performance hit of signing everything at rest and in transport, but the scalability of CESR and delegated KERI identifiers can change that.
