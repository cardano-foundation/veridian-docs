# Cardano Foundation Identity Wallet Documentation Site Repository

Welcome to the Cardano Foundation Identity Wallet Documentation Site. This site is generated using [Nextra](https://nextra.site/), a Next.js based static site generator. Follow the instructions below to get started with the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```console
   git clone https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cf-identity-wallet-documentation.git
   cd cf-identity-wallet-documentation
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```console
   npm i
   ```

## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```console
npm run dev
```

This will start the server and you can view the site by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser. The server supports hot reloading, so any changes you make to the files will automatically be reflected in the browser.
