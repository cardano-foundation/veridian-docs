# Veridian Docs

Welcome to the documentation site repository for the Veridian platform.
This site is generated using [Nextra](https://nextra.site/), a Next.js based static site generator.
Follow the instructions below to get started with the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```console
   git clone https://github.com/cardano-foundation/veridian-docs.git
   cd veridian-docs
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```console

## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

This will start the server and you can view the site by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
The server supports hot reloading, so any changes you make to the files will automatically be reflected in the browser.
