# Wallet recovery

If you created an Identity Wallet in the past and have since uninstalled the app or lost your phone, you can recover your previous wallet as long as you have your seed phrase.

To begin the recovery process, click on the “I already have a wallet” button located at the bottom of the screen.

  The first two steps of the recovery process are the same as those in the
  onboarding process. If needed, more information on creating a passcode and a
  password can be found in the [onboarding tutorial](/ballot/onboarding) page.

Once you have created a passcode and optionally a password, it's time to enter the old wallet recovery phrase. In each field, type the corresponding word. A list of suggestions will appear as you type; select the appropriate word, and the keyboard will focus on the next field. Repeat this process for the rest of the words, then click the "Confirm" button to continue to the next step.

Lastly, you will need to include your SSI agent details, if necessary.
