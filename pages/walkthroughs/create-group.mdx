# Creating a group identifier

The creation of a group identifier builds on the idea of [connections](/fundamentals/credentials).
All members of the group will need to set up connections with each other to communicate back and forth their usage of the identifier.

## Initial setup

One member acts as the initiator of a group and creates a new identifier in the wallet using the "Group" type.
At this point, a QR code will appear which can be shared with the other members of the desired group.
This QR code is slightly different and when scanned by other wallets it will automatically bootstrap setting up the group identifier on their device.

The other group members will also see a QR code appear on-screen which should be shared with the initiator and every _other_ group member.
Underneath the QR code you may also see the current members you have connected with.
These connections will only appear here and not in the main connections list in the wallet.

<Callout type="info">
  While sharing the QR codes, this identifiers will appear in a "For groups" section in the identifiers tab.
  It is effectively in a draft state at this point until the initiator decides it's time to finalise the creation.
</Callout>

## Finalise setup

Once all members are interconnected, the initiator can finalise the creation of the identifier.
At this point, the initiator can remove any undesired members and set a threshold.
The threshold decides how many members need to provide a signature when using the identifier or rotating keys.

Once finalised, a notification will be sent to all other members to accept the final configuration of the group.
The group identifier will be pending until a threshold amount of members accept.

<Callout type="info">
  If some connections are missing, those members will be prompted to finish scanning before they can accept the final configuration.
</Callout>

## Future improvements

There are a number of reasons that setting up the group identifier requires new connections, but we do recognise that pre-existing connections between group members could help bootstrap this process under the hood a bit better.
This is something we will be aiming to improve in collaboration with the wider KERI community!
