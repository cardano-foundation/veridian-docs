# Receiving a credential

We have created a tool to help development that allows you to create connections and issue credentials.
This tool can be accessed by this [link](https://cred-issuance-ui.idw.cardanofoundation.org/) and can be used to try out the credential related features of the Identity Wallet.

<Callout type="warning">
  The tool is not production ready and is only intended for testing and
  demonstrations.
</Callout>

## Connecting

On initial page load, you should land on the Connections tab with a QR code already displayed.
The scanner (center tab) may be used to scan connect with the tool.
A new connection named "CF Credential Issuance" should appear in your list of connections.

<div className="galery-container">
  <Image
    src="/img/more/credentials-testing-tool/create-connection/create-connection-1.png"
    width={350}
    height={300}
  />
  <Image
    src="/img/more/credentials-testing-tool/create-connection/create-connection-2.png"
    width={350}
    height={300}
  />
</div>

Once scanned, click the next step button on the credential tool.
You should have already created an individual identifier if you've voted in the Cardano Ballot awards; if not, please refer to [here](/ballot/create-identifier) to set that up.

<Callout type="info">
  It's possible to receive credentials to a group identifier too! However, the
  request to present flow is not fully complete for group identifiers so your
  experience might not be as smooth. Feel free to give it a go if possible - in
  general, accepting a credential or presenting a credential will require a
  threshold amount of members to agree.
</Callout>

You can share the QR code of this identifier with the credential tool from the identifier details page using the share button.
Alternatively, you can open the connections page, click the plus icon and click "Provide a QR code".

<div className="galery-container">
  <Image src="/img/common/identifier-details.png" width={350} height={300} />
  <Image
    src="/img/more/credentials-testing-tool/create-connection/create-connection-3.png"
    width={350}
    height={300}
  />
</div>

This QR code can be scanned by your browser if possible.
If not, the input field may be used along with the submit button!

<Callout type="info">
  If this is your first time using QR code scanner in the credential tool, you
  will need to request camera permissions.
</Callout>

Once connected, your identifier (and name) should appear in the list of connections at the end of the page.
From here it can also be deleted.

## Issue a credential

The "Issue Credential" [page](https://cred-issuance-ui.idw.cardanofoundation.org/issue-credential) may be used to finally get some credentials into your wallet.

From here, it's a pretty simple process. Lets issue a "Rare EVO Attendee" credential - we used this for demos this year at the RareEvo conference.

In the “Established Connections” dropdown menu, select the identifier you provided earlier.
Next, select the type of credential you want to issue - in this case, a "Rare EVO Attendee" credential.
Finally, enter your name in the Name field to personalise the credential and click on the "Issue Credential" button.

<Image

  height={700}
/>

You will receive a notification in the Identity Wallet.
Click on the “Notifications” tab in the menu to access it, and then click on the notification to begin the process to accept the credential issuance.

<div className="galery-container">
  <Image
    src="/img/more/credentials-testing-tool/issue-credential/issue-credential-2.png"
    width={350}
    height={300}
  />
  <Image
    src="/img/more/credentials-testing-tool/issue-credential/issue-credential-3.png"
    width={350}
    height={300}
  />
</div>

Once you have received the credential, you can access it by clicking on the Credentials tab in the menu and selecting the credential to view its details.

<Callout type="info">
  We are currently changing this credential notification page to display all of
  the details of the credential before accepting. Unfortunately, this did not
  make it into the Alpha Program build.
</Callout>

## Request to present

The "Request credential" tab may be used to send a request to the wallet to present or disclose a credential they hold.
Let's try that now with the Rare Evo credential we just received!

Select your identifier from the list - if you connected with multiple identifiers, make sure it's the one that received the credential!
Like before, select the "Rare Evo Attendee" credential type. You may leave the name blank or type the same name used before.

<Image
  src="/img/more/credentials-testing-tool/request-credential/request-credential-1.png"
  width={700}
  height={700}
/>

After clicking "Request Credential", another notification will appear in your wallet indicating that the credential tool wants a presentation.
If you have a matching credential, you can select this credential and present it.
If there are multiple matching credentials, you can pick the one you desire.

<div className="galery-container">
  <Image
    src="/img/more/credentials-testing-tool/request-credential/request-credential-2.png"
    width={350}
    height={300}
  />
  <Image
    src="/img/more/credentials-testing-tool/request-credential/request-credential-3.png"
    width={350}
    height={300}
  />
</div>

<Callout type="info">
  You may choose to archive a credential in your wallet.
  This helps keep your wallet clean while still maintaining a history of the credential.
  If you truly no longer want to hold this credential, it can be deleted after archiving.

In either case, archived or deleted credentials cannot be presented to verifiers.
You do however have the option to restore credentials from an archived state to use them again.

</Callout>

## Revocation

Finally, the "Revoke Credential" tab may be used to revoke an already issued credential.
For each connection, a list of all issued credentials is displayed and can be revoked.

<Image
  src="/img/more/credentials-testing-tool/revocation/revocation-1.png"
  width={700}
  height={700}
/>

Go ahead and revoke the credential you just presented.
You should receive a notification alerting you to the revocation, and the credential will no longer appear in the normal deck of credentials.
It will be moved into an "Archived & Revoked" credentials section.

    width={350}
    height={300}
  />

</div>
