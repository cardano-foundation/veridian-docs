# Onboarding

Once the app has been installed on your device, it's time to complete the onboarding process.
Click the "Get Started" button to begin.

<Callout type="info">
  If you need to recover a wallet, consult the [recovery
  tutorial](../settingsrecovery/recovery.mdx).
</Callout>

#### Passcode Creation & Biometrics

The Identity Wallet uses a passcode to secure the wallet and to confirm certain actions.
Enter and re-enter your 6-digit passcode to confirm its accuracy.

<Callout type="info">
  You can change the passcode at any time in the menu settings. More information
  on this process can be found [here](../settingsrecovery/change-passcode).
</Callout>

Before you proceed to the next step, a popup should appear requesting permissions to use biometrics for authentication.
This feature is optional and complements the passcode by allowing you to unlock your wallet using biometrics.
To enable this feature, click the "OK" button, and the device’s operating system will configure the biometrics settings:

- On Android, if available and enabled on your phone, the system will generally request a fingerprint.
- On iOS, follow the on-screen instructions to set up Face ID or Touch ID depending on the device.

<Callout type="info">
  You will only be asked to enable biometrics if your device supports secure
  biometrics. In Android, this is not always the case.
</Callout>

#### Operations Password

You can **optionally** create an operations password as a more secure alternative to the passcode.
Once you enable this password, you will need to use it instead of the passcode for certain operations.
The passcode or biometrics will still be used to unlock the app.

Enter the password twice to confirm its accuracy.
Optionally, you can create a hint to display if you forget the password.
Click the "Create Password" button at the bottom of the screen to continue.

If you prefer not to create a password, click the "Skip" button at the bottom of the screen and confirm your decision by clicking “Yes, skip” on the popup that appears.

<Callout type="info">
  You can set and manage this operations password later in the menu settings.
  For more information, refer to the [Manage Operations
  Password](../settingsrecovery/manage-operations-password) page.
</Callout>

#### Recovery Phrase

Now it’s time to generate the recovery phrase.
This phrase will help you recover your identity if you ever lose your phone or switch to another device.

Click on the “View Recovery Phrase” button to reveal your recovery phrase.

<Callout type="warning">
  It’s important to keep these words safe and sound! Store them in a secure
  location and remember to never share them with anyone.
</Callout>

Once you have written down the recovery phrase, accept the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy by clicking on the checkbox, and then click on the “Generate” button located at the bottom of the screen.

To verify that you have copied the recovery phrase correctly, you must enter the phrase to complete the verification process.

<div className="galery-container">

</div>

Once you have entered all the words, click on the “Verify” button to confirm that the entered words match your recovery phrase.

#### SSI Agent Details

The Identity Wallet leverages a cloud agent that runs KERI protocols and interfaces with other agents on the internet.
For the Alpha Program, we have provided access to a cloud agent for participants.
You can find the specific Boot and Connect URLs in the email that was distributed.
To add the URLs, the QR codes from the email should be scanned by clicking on the square icon to the left of each text field.
Alternatively, you are free to run your own infrastructure.

Please note that the Boot URL within the email is unique and can only be used once during normal onboarding.

<Callout type="info">
  The cloud agent simply helps interact with other wallets and services, and
  offload computationally expensive tasks to the cloud. Your identity is
  securely controlled from the Identity Wallet, and the keys never leave the
  device.
</Callout>

<Image src="/img/ballot/onboarding/onboarding-9.png" width={300} height={300} />

<Callout type="warning">
  Due to a necessary recent update to the camera plugin of the Identity Wallet, the QR
  code scanning feature may currently experience instability, particularly on
  iOS devices. This could result in occasional scanning failures. Our team is
  actively working on a solution, and we appreciate your understanding and
  patience as we resolve this issue.
</Callout>

#### Display Name

The final step in the onboarding process is to enter your display name.
When connecting to other wallets and services, this name will be shared.
