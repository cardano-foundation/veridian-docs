Each Cardano Connect connection requires an identifier to sign and verify information, such as votes cast in Cardano Ballot.
For this process, the identifier created in the previous chapter of this tutorial will be used.
Select the identifier and click the "Confirm" button.

<Callout type="warning">
  If the Cardano Ballot page is refreshed or reopened before closing the
  Identity Wallet, it will be necessary to manually disconnect and reconnect as
  shown in the image above.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  You should always reconnect to Cardano Ballot using the identifier that was
  used during the wallet verification process. While it is possible to connect
  using a different identifier, this will require the wallet to be verified
  again using a different method than previously used.
