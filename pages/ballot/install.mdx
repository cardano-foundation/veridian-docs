# Downloading and installing the Identity Wallet

The first step in this series of tutorials covers the process of installing the Identity Wallet on a device.
Since the Identity Wallet is in the alpha version and not publicly accessible for download in the App Store or Google Play Store, the following steps should be followed to complete the installation.

Follow the steps according to the operating system:

- [iOS](./install#ios)
- [Android](./install#android---google-play-store)

## iOS

#### TestFlight Installation

TestFlight, Apple's app testing service is used to install the Identity Wallet.
First of all you need to install the TestFlight application on your device.

Go to the [TestFlight page on the Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664) and install the application on your phone.

#### Identity Wallet Installation

If you selected iOS when signing up for the Alpha Program, you should have received an email from Apple TestFlight.
Open the received email and click the “View in TestFlight” button to go to the installation page of the Identity Wallet within the TestFlight App.

  If a page with a redeem code is displayed instead of the Identity Wallet
  installation page, it means the TestFlight app needs to be installed. The
  on-screen instructions should be followed to complete the process.
