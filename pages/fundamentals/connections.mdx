# Connections

Identifiers alone aren't very useful!
Connections allow us to talk to other wallets and services using the same identity standards.

Any identifier you create in the wallet can be shared with others by way of QR code, which is effectively an endpoint on your cloud agent.
For technical folk, this is known as an [Out of Band Introduction](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/#out-of-band-introduction-oobi) and is a way to bootstrap a secure connection with an identifier.

## How to connect

You can connect to another wallet or service by scanning their connection QR code.
If the connection cannot be established right away, it will be pending and eventually complete in the background.
If not, you can always delete the pending connection.

Likewise, you must share your QR code with the other party so they can connect with you.
We're working on improving the user experience here by having a more interactive connection flow.

<Callout type="info">
  We mentioned in the previous section that you may also create a number of ephemeral identifiers to protect your privacy more.
  This is currently not yet supported, so you will always be sharing a direct connection to another party.

Our hope is to support the [Trust Spanning Protocol](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-tsp-specification/) for this purpose.

## History and notes

Within the details of a connection you will find a history of interactions.
This can include activities such as being issued a credential from that connection.

You can also add some notes to the connection.
These are completely personal and are never shared with the other party.
