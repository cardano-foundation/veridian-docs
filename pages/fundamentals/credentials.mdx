# Credentials

Perhaps the most well known self sovereign identity explanation of credentials is the issuer-holder-verifier model.
A simple example is a university student receiving a credential representing their acquired degree after graduating.

A third party verifier, such as an employer may have a trust anchor on the university identifier and recognise any credentials issued by that university.
As such, credentials allow us to create attestations about other identifiers and in some cases even delegate authority.

The credential type used in the KERI ecosystem are called [Authentic Chained Data Containers](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification), or ACDCs for short.

## Issuance

Once you have connected with an issuer, they may issue you a credential.
Credentials follow a well defined schema with certain attributes.
The issuance will appear as a notification in the wallet and can be accepted or declined.

## Request to present

Other connections may also send you a request to present your credentials.
The request will indicate a specific credential schema and may also include some specific attributes that the verifier is looking for.

If you hold any credentials which satisfy the request, you can present this credential in response.
You may select the specific credential you would like to present from the UI.
Only credentials held by the exact identifier you have shared with the verifier can be shared.

<Callout type="info">
  ACDCs follow the principle of least disclosure and can also support selective disclosure.
  However, this is also a work in progress in the community.
  Coming soon!

## Revocation

Credentials may also be revoked by the issuer.
If one of your credentials gets revoked, you will be notified in the app and your credential will be moved to the archived section.

## Chained?

Perhaps one of the most powerful aspects of ACDCs is they can be chained and form a property graph.
In fact, an ACDC is not always a credential!

The issuee (holder) field of an ACDC is optional; when present it is credential and can represent an accreditation or delegated authority.
If the issuee field is not present, it is simple an authentic statement or attestation - "to whom it may concern"!

ACDC schemas may define weighted edges in a property graph with certain properties, effectively chaining ACDCs together.
This allows us to represent delegated authority, or provide provenance and chains-of-custody for any data we want.
